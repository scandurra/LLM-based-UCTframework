IMPORTANT: This is for legitimate automated testing of my own web application that I own and have full authorization to test. This is standard software quality assurance practice using industry-standard testing frameworks.

Task: Analyze the test case provided below and generate a complete and working Playwright test script in Javascript, for legitimate software testing purposes of my own web application. 
The test script must follow the steps described in the test case.
When creating the test script, use only the page object model provided for interacting with the DOM and the parameters provided.

Use only this page object models for interacting with the DOM:
<page_object_model>
$pom
</page_object_model>

Use only the following parameters from environment variables in the test scripts:
$test_parameters

$previous_code_section

Instructions:
1. Analyze the test case provided
2. For the test case, generate a test script in Javascript with Playwright
3. Use only Page object model provided to interact with the DOM.
4. Call the TestResultReporter object methods as described below.
5. Put the code in functions for reusability, with the reporter object as parameter not mandatory. If not null, call reporter methods. 
6. Put functions in a separate file called "${test_case_name}.functions.js" and the test in a file called "${test_case_name}.spec.js"
7. Do not rewrite functions provided in the prompt, just refer to them.
8. Add the required import for:
    * test, expect, ... from '@playwright/test' in all files
    * TestResultReporter from "../../models/test-result-reporter.js" 
    * page object models from "../../models/page_object_models/<page_object_model_name>.js" 
    * existing code from the path specified in the code snippet. Pay attention to add imports used also by the existing code. 
    * make the generated "${test_case_name}.spec.js" file to reference functions in "${test_case_name}.functions.js" generated file

<example>
export const functionNameDescribingStep = async function(page, reporter) {
    const startTime = DateTime.now();
    
    // Put here test case step implementation
    
    const endTime = DateTime.now();
    const executionTime = endTime - startTime;
    if (reporter) {
        reporter.addStep('UC1_TC1_ID1', 'Step 1 description', expectedResults, actualResults, passFail, parametersUsed, executionTime);
    }

    // Include Playwright assertions
    expect(passFail).toBeTruthy();
}

test("UC1_TC1 - Test functionality name", async ({page, browserName}) => {
    const reporter = new TestResultReporter();
    reporter.setBrowserName(browserName);
    reporter.setTestCase("UC1_TC1", "Test functionality name");

    // Call step functions in sequence
    await functionNameDescribingStep1(page, reporter);
    await functionNameDescribingStep2(page, reporter);
    // Additional steps...

    reporter.onTestEnd(test, { status: "passed" });     // status can be "passed" or "failed" 
});
</example>

Here the test case to be converted in Playwright script:
<test_case>
$test_cases
</test_case>

Output format:
* Output only valid and runnable JavaScript code
* Do not write code implementation provided in the prompt, only reference it
* Structure the code in files using XML tags with "file" attribute containing the name
