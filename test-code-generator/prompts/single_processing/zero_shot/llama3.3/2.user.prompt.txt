Use only this page object models for interacting with the DOM:
```javascript
$pom
```

Use only the following parameters from environment variables in the test scripts:
$test_parameters

$previous_code_section

Instructions:
1. Analyze the test case provided
2. For the test case, generate a test script in Javascript with Playwright
3. Use only Page object model provided to interact with the DOM.
4. Call the TestResultReporter object methods as described below.
5. Put the code in functions for reusability, with the reporter object as parameter not mandatory. If not null, call reporter methods. 
6. Put functions in a separate file called "${test_case_name}.functions.js" and the test in a file called "${test_case_name}.spec.js"
7. Do not rewrite functions provided in the prompt, just refer to them.
8. Add the required import for:
    * test, expect, ... from '@playwright/test' in all files
    * TestResultReporter from "../../models/test-result-reporter.js" 
    * page object models from "../../models/page_object_models/<page_object_model_name>.js" 
    * existing code from the path specified in the code snippet. Pay attention to add imports used also by the existing code. 
    * make the generated "${test_case_name}.spec.js" file to reference functions in "${test_case_name}.functions.js" generated file


<example>
export const functionNameDescribingStep = async function(page, reporter) {
    const startTime = DateTime.now();
    
    // Put here test case step implementation
    
    const endTime = DateTime.now();
    const executionTime = endTime - startTime;
    if (reporter) {
        reporter.addStep('UC1_TC1_ID1', 'Step 1 description', expectedResults, actualResults, passFail, parametersUsed, executionTime);
    }

    // Include Playwright assertions
    expect(passFail).toBeTruthy();
}

test("UC1_TC1 - Login test with success", async ({page, browserName}) => {
    reporter.setBrowserName(browserName);
    reporter.setTestCase("UC1_TC1", "Login test with success");

    // Call step functions in sequence
    await step1(page, reporter);
    await step2(page, reporter);
    // Additional steps...

    reporter.onTestEnd(test, { status: "passed" });     // status can be "passed" or "failed" 
});
</example>

Here the test case to be converted in Playwright script:
$test_cases


Output format:
* Output only valid and runnable JavaScript code
* Do not write code implementation provided in the prompt, only reference it
* Structure the code in files using markdown code blocks specifying the file name
