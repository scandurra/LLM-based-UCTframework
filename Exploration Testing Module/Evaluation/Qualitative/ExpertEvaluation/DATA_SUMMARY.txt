DIMENSIONS BY STRATEGY
----------------------
                          Zero-Shot    One-Shot     Few-Shot
Clarity & Completeness:   4.22±0.64    4.50±0.65    4.67±0.48 (BEST)
Semantic Consistency:     3.50±0.91    4.25±0.65    4.31±0.58

Key Insight: One-Shot has HIGHEST creativity (4.86)
             Few-Shot has HIGHEST clarity (4.67) but LOWEST creativity (3.92)
             Suggests "over-fitting" in Few-Shot

BY EXPERT
---------
Expert 1: 4.24 ± 0.74 (n=144)
Expert 2: 4.12 ± 0.68 (n=144) - Most critical
Expert 3: 4.35 ± 0.82 (n=144) - Most generous (formerly Expert 4)

Note: Expert 3 data was excluded; Expert 4 renamed to Expert 3

BY USE CASE
-----------
UC1:     4.34 ± 0.66 (n=108) - BEST
UC3.3:   4.31 ± 0.68 (n=108)
UC3.4.4: 4.19 ± 0.71 (n=108)
UC2.4:   4.12 ± 0.92 (n=108) - MOST VARIABLE

Note: UC2.4 has highest standard deviation (0.92), indicating inconsistent results

INTER-EXPERT AGREEMENT
----------------------
Mean inter-expert variance: 0.317 ± 0.405
Perfect agreements (all 3 experts same rating): 54/144 = 37.5%
Close agreements (diff ≤ 1): 127/144 = 88.2%

R2: 4.30 ± 0.74 (n=144)
R3: 4.19 ± 0.78 (n=144)

Note: Very consistent across rounds, no significant trend

BEST PERFORMING COMBINATIONS (UC × Strategy)
---------------------------------------------
1. UC2.4 - R2 One Shot: 4.92
2. UC1 - R1 One Shot: 4.83
3. UC1 - R2 One Shot: 4.67
4. UC2.4 - R3 One Shot: 4.67
5. UC3.3 - R2 Few Shot: 4.58

Note: 4 out of top 5 use One-Shot strategy

WORST PERFORMING COMBINATIONS
------------------------------
1. UC3.4.4 - R3 Zero Shot: 3.33
2. UC2.4 - R1 One Shot: 3.67
3. UC2.4 - R2 Zero Shot: 3.67
4. UC2.4 - R1 Zero Shot: 3.67
5. UC2.4 - R3 Few Shot: 3.75

Note: UC2.4 appears in 4 out of 5 worst cases

KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
--------------------
1. One-Shot is the best strategy (4.49 vs 3.89 Zero-Shot, 4.35 Few-Shot)
   - Improvement of 0.60 points over Zero-Shot
   - Highest creativity score (4.86)

2. Few-Shot shows "over-fitting" pattern:
   - Best clarity (4.67) but lowest creativity (3.92)
   - Follows examples too closely, lacks innovation

3. Zero-Shot struggles with Semantic Consistency (3.50):
   - Without examples, LLM has difficulty with logical flow
   - Still maintains reasonable structure (Clarity: 4.22)

4. UC2.4 is most challenging use case:
   - Highest variability (SD = 0.92)
   - Both best (4.92) and worst (3.67) individual results

5. Expert agreement is strong:
   - 88.2% within 1 point
   - Validates evaluation framework

6. LLM excels at structure, sometimes struggles with logic:
   - High Clarity & Completeness (4.46)
   - Lower Semantic Consistency (4.02)

7. Hallucinations are rare but present:
   - Context Deviation: 4.22
   - Only 43.5% rated "Excellent"

8. Generation is stable across rounds:
   - R1, R2, R3 all within 0.11 points (4.19-4.30)
